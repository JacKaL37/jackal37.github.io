## Digital Fidgeting

Part of my daily workflow lately is using https://evolvecode.io/ to futz around and get my programmatic and project development juices flowing. 

Some of the fidgety digital bullshiit I've created:

- [fireflies](jackal37.github.io/digitalFidgets/fireflies.html)
- [tinkleboom]((jackal37.github.io/digitalFidgets/tinkleboom.html))
