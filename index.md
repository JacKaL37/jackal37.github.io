## Agentic Tool Tinkering
*likely Autogen*

- Video Curriculum Digestion Swarm -- I have 100+ hours of video content from my time teaching during the pandemic. I made all my own materials (i.e., didn't use textbooks), so... let's throw that in reverse. Working on digesting, atomizing, and recombobulating all the Stuff What I Done Talked About those five years into a more useful structures: documents, textbook chapters, wiki knowledgebases, etc.
- Cognitive Bias Task Battery -- building up a repertoire of cognitive bias tasks, ala the [Cognitive Bias Codex](media/CognitiveBiasCodex.svg) for exploring the extent to which cognitive biases exhibit in large language models (and other foundation models). After all, they're constructed from *human* data-- how many of our logical flaws have they inherited? Example: when does a given LLM exhibit Confirmation Bias? Can they be prompted out of these erros? Prompted into them? And if it DOES exhibit this behavior, does it manifest consistently under complex use cases, or is it largely irrelevant? 

## open source LLM project tinkering
- Mindcraft -- expanding the capabilities of the MinDcraft Minecraft bot, trying to imbue it with a bit more sense of its presence in the world, etc.  
- CodeEvolver -- enhancing this rapid prototyping tool with more features, focusing on ES6 module imports over CDN as a lean way to develop standalone, single-file component pages (Vue3 is the current focus, React has too much representation already) that can be easily converted into node/server version with minimal fuss. 
    
## Digital Fidgeting

Part of my daily workflow lately is using https://evolvecode.io/ to futz around and get my programmatic and project development juices flowing. 

Some of the fidgety digital bullshiit I've created:
- [inkstroke](digitalFidgets/inkstroke.html)
- [fireflies](digitalFidgets/fireflies.html)
- [tinkleboom](digitalFidgets/tinkleboom.html)
- [doctree](digitalFidgets/doctree.html)
- [palettest](digitalFidgets/palettest.html)
- [binauralfreak](digitalFidgets/binauralfreak.html)
- [heyguy](digitalFidgets/heyguy.html)
- [featurecreep](digitalFidgets/featurecreep.html) - this one's all gpt-4o. i just cheered it on telling it to add more features.
